Okay, so you're in a steam room, cool, but is it ordinary? You better believe it is.

What's that over there? It looks like it's a locker. You can see a spherical chest. The spherical chest contains a keycard. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You can see an open cabinet. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You can make out an open drawer close by. The drawer is empty, what a horrible day! You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is typical. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. What's the point of an empty counter?

There is a closed gateway leading east. There is a closed passageway leading west.
