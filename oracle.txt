You make out an open cabinet right there by you. The cabinet is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You can make out a bench. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. On the bench you can make out a latchkey. Hmmm... what else, what else?

There is an open spherical passageway leading north. There is a closed gateway leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked.
